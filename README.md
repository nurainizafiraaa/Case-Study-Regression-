# üè° Boston Housing Price Prediction ‚Äì Regularized Regression (Ridge & Lasso)

### Data Science & Data Analyst Bootcamp  
Module: *Simple & Multiple Regression Models (Supervised) + Regularized Regression in Python*


## üéØ Project Overview
This case study focuses on **predicting house prices** using the **Boston Housing Dataset** through **Regularized Regression models** ‚Äî specifically **Ridge** and **Lasso Regression**.  
The goal is to build, compare, and interpret regression models that can accurately predict housing prices while avoiding overfitting through proper feature selection and regularization.


## üß† Objectives
- Split dataset into **training**, **validation**, and **test sets**.
- Perform **correlation analysis** and remove redundant features.
- Build **Ridge Regression** and **Lasso Regression** models.
- Identify optimal regularization parameters using validation set.
- Evaluate models using metrics such as **MAE**, **RMSE**, and **MAPE**.
- Interpret regression coefficients and compare model performance.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Information
**Dataset:** [Boston Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikrishnan/boston-house-prices)  

Each record represents housing data from suburbs of Boston with multiple socio-economic and structural features.
